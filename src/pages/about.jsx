        <h3 className="section-title">🪔 Origins of Painting</h3>
        <p>
          All letters originated from paintings. Ancient people expressed their thoughts first with signals,
          then by drawing. Even the great Tamil poet Kamban acknowledged the divine nature of portraits in his works.

        <h3 className="section-title">🎨 Tanjore Painting</h3>
        <p>
          Tanjore painting flourished under the Sahu Maharaja Dynasty and was patronized by King Sarfoji in the 16th century.
          The process involves sketching on a cloth-pasted wooden board, using chukkan flour, artificial stones, applying gold foil,
          and finishing with watercolor to create radiant artwork that lasts generations.

        <h3 className="section-title">🪟 Glass Painting</h3>
        <p>
          Introduced by the Chinese in the 18th century and supported by Tipu Sultan, this art form uses reverse painting techniques
          on transparent glass. First drawn parts are painted last — an intricate process that results in long-lasting, vibrant images.

        <h3 className="section-title">🏛️ Patrons of the Art</h3>
        <p>
          Kings and nobles, from Ajanta to Tanjore Palace, honored artists. The Chettiar community also embraced this art deeply,
          decorating homes with hand-drawn portraits even before photography existed. Reputed works by poets like Namakkal Kavignar
          still decorate their homes today.

        <h3 className="section-title">🎓 My Journey as an Artist</h3>
        <p>
          Inspired by my mother Nachammai Achi and supported by my father RM. SV. Ramanathan Chettiar, I began drawing kolams on
          vessels and floors. I trained under Mr. Athimoolam, studied at Chittaal Achi Memorial School, and evolved through experiences
          like “Ovia Velvi” where we painted 108 Lord Vinayagars on glass. My painting of “Rishaba Arudhar” (6x4) now resides at
          Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple, Kandanur.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've received recognition including the Mahatma Gandhi Award, and my paintings are displayed in the homes of dignitaries like
          Union Minister P. Chidambaram. I remain deeply thankful for the encouragement from Dr. A.C. Muthiah and family.
        </p>
        <p className="fw-bold">I humbly appeal to the State and Central Governments to support and preserve this divine form of art.</p>
